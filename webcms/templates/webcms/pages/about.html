                <p>
                    A military man is first a servant to his allegiance before anything else, even their own families. His dreams and aspirations are an afterthought when it comes to service. Therefore, HDA has come to be a support to the children of late military personnel given that these fallen heroes were parents and every dream of a parent is the settlement and fulfillment of their children.
                    HDA‘s aim is to shield children of fallen heroes from being victims of circumstances
                    and proffer them an equitable footing to win in life.
